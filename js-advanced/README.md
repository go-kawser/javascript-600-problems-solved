# JS Advanced | Deep Dives and Practical Patterns

This folder contains advanced, carefully curated JavaScript examples and problems that demonstrate deep language features, real-world patterns, and performance-aware solutions. It's built for developers preparing for senior/technical interviews, engineers wanting to sharpen practical skills, and clients reviewing code quality and engineering judgment.

**Contents are focused on clarity, correctness, and teachability:** each file isolates a single advanced concept, includes explanatory comments, and provides small runtime examples so you can inspect behavior quickly.

## Why this folder matters

- Demonstrates deep understanding of JavaScript internals (execution model, event loop, memory, prototypal inheritance).
- Shows real-world patterns: async control flow, streams, generators, functional composition, module boundaries, and performance trade-offs.
- Useful for technical interviews, code reviews, and training sessions where compact, well-organized examples convey skill.

## Topics covered---> high level

- Advanced functions: currying, partial application, higher-order functions, decorators
- Asynchronous patterns: Promises, async/await, cancellation, concurrency primitives, scheduling
- Event loop and microtasks/macrotasks, timers, and real-world pitfalls
- Memory and performance: time/space complexity, profiling hints, GC-aware patterns
- Prototypes, classes, inheritance, and delegation patterns
- Modules and bundling considerations (ESM/CJS differences, tree-shaking implications)
- Generators, iterators, and lazy evaluation
- Error handling strategies and robust defensive coding
- Testing patterns for asynchronous and side-effect code

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js (LTS recommended; v16+ preferred)

Run an example file from the project root using PowerShell:

```powershell
cd js-advanced
node some-advanced-file.js
```

Files are intended to run standalone and log concise, explanatory output. Replace `some-advanced-file.js` with any filename from this directory.

## How to use this folder effectively

1. Pick a topic you want to study (e.g., `generators`, `async-await`, `event-loop`).
2. Read the top comments to understand the objective and expected behavior.
3. Run the file, inspect console output, then change inputs to experiment with edge cases.
4. Try to re-implement the core idea in a new file, then compare patterns and complexity.

## Example snapshots

- Async concurrency control: compare sequential, parallel, and limited concurrency implementations and observe runtime differences.
- Memory-aware iteration: use generators/iterators to process large datasets lazily rather than building full in-memory arrays.
- Event loop demo: illustrate microtask ordering using Promises vs setTimeout.

## Contract: inputs, outputs, and guarantees

- **Inputs:** small scripts that either log results or export a function for direct import.
- **Outputs:** deterministic console output for examples; exported functions avoid side effects when intended for unit tests.
- **Guarantees:** examples prefer correctness and readability over clever micro-optimizations unless the file specifically demonstrates performance trade-offs.

**Edge cases to test when modifying examples:**

- Large or streaming data sources (avoid building huge arrays in memory)
- Cancellation and cleanup (timeouts, event listeners, file descriptors)
- Mixed sync/async error paths and unhandled promise rejections

## Contribution guidelines

**New contributions should follow these principles:**

1. One advanced concept per file. Keep files focused and titled clearly using kebab-case (`async-concurrency.js`).
2. Include a short header comment describing the motivation, expected behavior, and complexity characteristics.
3. Add a small runnable example (console output) and a short unit-testable function exported where appropriate.
4. Prefer pure functions for unit-testable logic; keep side effects isolated to example runners.
5. When adding performance comparisons, include measured results (times, memory) and the test environment used.

Create a PR with a descriptive title ("add: async limited-concurrency example + tests") and a short summary of trade-offs demonstrated.

## Testing and Validation

**This folder does not enforce a test harness by default to remain lightweight. Recommended approach to add tests:**

1. Add (or update) a `package.json` at the repo root with a lightweight test runner like Jest or Vitest.
2. Export pure functions from example files so they can be imported into unit tests under `__tests__/`.
3. Add one or two tests per concept: happy path and one edge case (e.g., cancellation or invalid input).

If you'd like, I can scaffold tests and a `package.json` for this repo.

### Code style and quality

- Use modern JS patterns (const/let, destructuring, async/await where clearer).
- Prefer clear, testable APIs rather than inline script-only logic.
- Add short comments for non-obvious decisions - especially trade-offs and performance assumptions.
- Include small benchmarks or runtime observations when demonstrating performance-sensitive code.

### Security and Safety Notes

- Avoid executing untrusted inputs in examples. Examples that demonstrate parsing or evaluation should sanitize inputs or clearly warn the reader.
- For file/IO/network examples, clean up resources and handle errors explicitly.

#### Contact and Next Steps

**Want this folder to be production-ready for client review? I can:**

- Add a minimal `package.json` and test runner with one example test.
- Add CI badges and a small contributors guide (`CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- Create a short showcase script that runs a few representative advanced examples and prints a summary.

  **Tell me which of the above you'd like next and I will scaffold it.**
